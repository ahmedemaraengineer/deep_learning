## Machine Learning Collection
in this repository I'm collection basic implementations of neural networks
using the state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks such as:
* pytorch
* tensorflow

in the first folder of basic implementations I have created some basic neural networks such as:
* Fully Connected Neural Networks
* Convolutions Neural Networks
* Recurrent Neural Networks
